# CIFAR-10 CNN Classifier

This project demonstrates a CNN-based approach to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using TensorFlow and Keras.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
## Summary
The trained model reached a test accuracy of over 89% with a relatively simple model-structure and only minor overfitting due to different regularization techniques like Dropout, and EarlyStopping. But there is still a lot of optimization potential.
